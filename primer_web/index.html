            <div class="paragraph"><p>Labeled "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", the Avengers originally consisted of Iron Man, the Wasp, the Hulk, Thor, and Ant-Man. The original Captain 
                America was discovered trapped in ice in issue #4, and joined the group after they revived him. A rotating roster became a hallmark of the series, although one theme 
                remained consistent: the Avengers fight "the foes no single superhero can withstand." The team, famous for its battle cry of "Avengers Assemble!", has featured humans, 
                superhumans, mutants, Inhumans, deities, androids, aliens, legendary beings, and even former villains.</p></div>

            <div class="paragraph"><p>The Avengers have appeared in a wide variety of media outside of comic books, including several different animated television series and direct-to-video films. 
                The Avengers also play a central role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) being the focus in multiple MCU feature films, beginning with the eponymous 2012 live-action film, The Avengers, 
                and followed by the sequels, Age of Ultron (2015), Infinity War (2018), and Endgame (2019), which were based on The Infinity Gauntlet storyline. The Avengers also featured in Captain America: 
                Civil War (2016) drawing loosely from the 2006 comics storyline "Civil War"</p></div>

                <p>The team debuted in The Avengers #1 (Sept. 1963). Much like the Justice League, the Avengers were an assemblage of superheroes who each had an existing series of his own. All of the 
                    characters were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. This initial series, published bi-monthly through issue #6 (July 1964) and monthly thereafter ran through issue #402 (Sept. 1996), 
                    with spinoffs including several annuals, miniseries and a giant-size quarterly sister series that ran briefly in the mid-1970s.[2] Writers of the first series included Roy Thomas, 
                    Steve Englehart, Gerry Conway, Jim Shooter and David Michelinie. Artists included John Buscema, Tom Palmer, Neal Adams, George Perez, John Byrne and Jim Starlin.
